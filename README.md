## Use it

### In browser

[![](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/@formulajs/formulajs/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@formulajs/formulajs)

Powered by [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), you can use the latest version of Formula.js:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@formulajs/formulajs/lib/browser/formula.min.js"></script>
```

Then the functions can be accessed as

```javascript
formulajs.DATE(2008, 7, 8)
formulajs.SUM([1, 2, 3])
...
```

### In node

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@formulajs/formulajs?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formulajs/formulajs) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@formulajs/formulajs?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formulajs/formulajs)

Install the package:

```
npm i @formulajs/formulajs
```

#### import

```javascript
import * as formulajs from '@formulajs/formulajs' // import entire package

formulajs.SUM([1, 2, 3]) // 6
```

```javascript
import { SUM } from '@formulajs/formulajs' // import individual components

SUM([1, 2, 3]) // 6
```

#### require

```javascript
const formulajs = require('@formulajs/formulajs') // require entire package

formulajs.SUM([1, 2, 3]) // 6
```

```javascript
const { SUM } = require('@formulajs/formulajs') // require individual components

SUM([1, 2, 3]) // 6
```

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

When Formula.js is installed globally using npm, it can be used from the command line. To install Formula.js globally:

```
npm i -g @formulajs/formulajs
```

After installation, Formula.js is available via the command line:

```sh
$ formulajs
> SUM(1,2,3)
6
```

## Differences between Excel functions and Formula.js

### Date

The functions `DATE, DATEVALUE, EDATE, EOMONT, NOW, TODAY`return plain JS Date instead of the serial Excel number.

Copying composite formula directly from Excel into JS will not work out of the box:

```
= DATE(2020,5,9) - DATE(2020,5,8) // Formula.js: 86400000 / Excel: 1
```

It is not recommended to use `DATEVALUE` to parse string representing a date. Formula.js uses `new Date('YOUR STRING')` under the hood. There are better libraries to do this job (for example Moment.js)

## Migration guide

### From Formula.js

If you were previously using [formulajs from Sutoiku](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formulajs), some functions have been
removed, due to dependency simplification.

Text functions:

`FIXED, TEXT, DOLLAR, VALUE`

Math functions:

`MDETERM, MINVERSE, MMULT, MUNIT`

Otherwise the 2 packages are fully compatible. You can swap them.

### From @handsontable/formulajs

The code of this package is originally forked from @handsontable/formulajs version 2.0.2 (released in January 2020). The
two packages were identical at the time. There is no regression, only fixes and new functions since the fork.

## Historic

This project is forked from [handsontable/formula.js](https://github.com/handsontable/formula.js) and it's developed for
everyone needs.

Original Formula.js project was developed and maintained by Ismael Chang Ghalimi, with support from STOIC and help from
the following contributors: Ilmari Karonen, Sébastien Loisel, Trevor Norris, Roönaän, Hannes Stiebitzhofer.

It was then forked and extended by the [handsontable/formula.js](https://github.com/handsontable/formula.js) mainly
contributed by [@budnix](https://github.com/budnix).

## Contributions and road map 2022

The road map in the coming month is to gather the improvements made in the main forks of the original project. If you
forked and made changes to sutoiku/formula.js do not hesitate to propose a pull request with your changes.

To avoid any regression or miss calculation please provide unit tests as long as function improvements.
